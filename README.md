# TG19264ALibrary
Library to interface with TG19264A Display using ATmega32A for start
This is hobby project to create library for interfacing with Display.
Future plans:
  - finish proposed functions
  - use of preprocessor for choosing between using simple AVR(tiny/mega) I/O interface or function declared by user. (e.g. outputFun(uint8_t Byte) for sending 1 Byte to display)
  - adding new functions if needed
